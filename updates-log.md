Version 0.0.1 log:

First version made, most of the basic features are there: generating documents (some truth worthy, some not), checking if the user did the correct decision, at the end of the day, the system of paying for food or heat and the day time. The main problem is: there aren't, in fact, any special events (programmed events) or new changes of gameplay for the day 4 and beyond. I think there isn't any bug from the day 1 to 3.
