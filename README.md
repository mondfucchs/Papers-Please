# Papers-Please

'Python, Please' is a small recreation of the game 'Papers, Please' by Lucas Pope. Although this recreation is text-based, it has most of the features (at least, the possible ones) of 'Papers, Please'. 

(It is still in a beta phase, so there... well, isn't bulletins or special events from the day 4 and beyond.)
Right now the project is being made by Mondfuchs. If you are here, play it and give some feedback!
